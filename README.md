# Kubernetes Web Application Deployment

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple web application using Docker and Kubernetes. The application is containerized using Docker, and Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of the application.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Docker Container

- **Dockerfile**: Define the image, dependencies, and commands necessary to create the Docker image for the web application.

### 2. Build and Push the Docker Image

- **Build the Docker Image**: Use `docker build` to create the Docker image based on the Dockerfile.
- **Push the Docker Image**: Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for access and use in Kubernetes.

### 3. Set up a Kubernetes Cluster

- **Set up Minikube (for local development)**: Use Minikube to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and development.

### 4. Create Kubernetes Deployment YAML

- **Deployment YAML**: Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file that defines the deployment for the web application, specifying the image, replicas, and other configurations.

### 5. Apply Deployment to the Cluster

- **Applying the Deployment**: Use `kubectl apply -f your_deployment.yaml` to deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. Expose the Application

- **Creating a Service YAML**: Create a Kubernetes Service YAML file to expose the application to external traffic.
- **Applying the Service**: Use `kubectl apply -f your_service.yaml` to create the service and expose the application.

### 7. Access the Web Application

- **Accessing the Application**: Access the web application via the service endpoint obtained using `kubectl get svc`.

### 8. Scale the Application

- **Scaling the Application**: Use `kubectl scale` to adjust the number of replicas for the application, allowing Kubernetes to manage the scaling.

## Getting Started

Follow the step-by-step guide in the "Steps" section to deploy the web application using Docker and Kubernetes.
